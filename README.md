I'm writing an undergraduate thesis on elliptic curves. I do a lot of exploring, plotting, and
playing with elliptic curves. Here are a couple projects that I've been working on recently. 

- [Spherically Projecting Elliptic Curves](https://ctesta01.github.io/thesis-blog/html/Feb25-Spherical-Projections.html)
- Subgroup Structure in F_p
- Geometrically Understanding the a-invariants
