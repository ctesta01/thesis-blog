I'm writing a thesis on elliptic curves. I do a lot of exploring, plotting, and
playing with elliptic curves. I have a couple projects that I've been working on recently. 

- [Spherically Projecting Elliptic Curves]()
- [Subgroup Structure in $\mathbb F_p$]()
- [Geometrically Understanding the $a$-invariants]()
