This is the github repository for my [thesis website](https://ctesta01.github.io/thesis-blog/).

I have a couple projects that I've been working on recently. 

- [Spherically Projecting Elliptic Curves]()
- [Subgroup Structure in $\mathbb F_p$]()
- [Geometrically Understanding the $a$-invariants]()
