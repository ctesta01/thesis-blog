I'm writing an undergraduate thesis on elliptic curves. I do a lot of exploring, plotting, and
playing with elliptic curves. Here are a couple projects that I've been working on recently. 

- [Spherically Projecting Elliptic Curves]()
- [Subgroup Structure in F_p]()
- [Geometrically Understanding the a-invariants]()
