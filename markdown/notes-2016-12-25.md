## Question about Sagemath

I'm putting this here, because I haven't been able to post it on ask.Sagemath
and I'm waiting for the google group sage-nt to admit me (maybe)?

----

I've tried a couple different methods for trying to limit the amount of time sage takes to calculate the rank of an elliptic curve. This is an example that takes a long time to compute:

    E = EllipticCurve([ -1/36, -1/36, 0, -1, 1 ])
    E.rank()

I've tried suggestions from

 - [stackoverflow post 1](http://stackoverflow.com/a/366763/3161979)
 - [stackoverflow post 2](http://stackoverflow.com/a/601168/3161979)
 - [filosophy blog post](https://www.filosophy.org/post/32/python_function_execution_deadlines__in_simple_examples/)

Each of these has seemed to work for trivial examples, but I haven't been able to get this to work with rank calculations like the example above.

Does anybody have any suggestions that might work for me?

My goal is to print details about an elliptic curve to a file, and if it can't compute the rank quickly enough to write something like "difficult to calculate" and move on to printing the rest of the information.

His response:

> Use either "alarm" or "fork", both of which are built into Sage.
We've had to properly solve exactly the problems you've run into a
decade ago already (with many iterations since), and make those
solutions work in the context of the very complicated Sage library
(which involves C libraries, external processes, etc.).

> Type "alarm?" or "fork?" or google the sagemath docs.
