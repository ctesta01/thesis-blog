![Akiyama-Tanigawa Plots as rank increases](https://i.imgur.com/ox33qXB.gif)

I think I've gone overboard with the plots. Nobody needs this many plots. I started out with "better safe than sorry" and "aren't they so pretty (re: modular forms plots)" and now I have just far too many plots.

Nonetheless, Stein's [convergence talk](http://wstein.org/talks/20071016-convergence/talk.pdf) is convincing regarding the correlation between the rate of convergence and the rank of a curve. It sure would be interesting to know what's going on there. The gif above was made with the following code snippet:
```python
sage_curves = []
for i in range(0, 28):
    # this returns at maximum 10 curves
    E_list = elliptic_curves.rank(i)
    for j in range(0,len(E_list)):
        sage_curves.append(E_list[j])

sage_database_rank_range_path = os.path.join(sato_tate_dist_path, 'sage_db_rank_range')
os.mkdir(sage_database_rank_range_path)

# make output
saving_ec_plots_and_data(sage_curves, sage_database_rank_range_path, time_limit=15, an_limit=N)
```

[`saving_ec_plots_and_data`](https://github.com/ctesta01/thesis-blog/blob/master/code/sato-tate-convergence.sage#L271) is a function I've written to output (too many) plots. You can view the rest of the code that I've written for plotting details of an elliptic curve family [here](https://github.com/ctesta01/thesis-blog/blob/master/code/2016-12-29%20saving-family-data.sage).

To study these results (without another gif), I have this code snippet which grabs up to 100 curves of a given rank and averages the values of $-\log(\Delta)/\log(C)$ for $C \leq 1000$.
```python
data = []

for i in range(0,29):
    E_list = elliptic_curves.rank(n=100, rank=i)
    for j in range(0,len(E_list)):
        E = E_list[j]
        if E.has_cm(): continue
        S = SatoTate(E, 1000)
        s = S.compute_theta(1000)
        t = [t[1] for t in s]
        data.append((i, mean(t)))

scatter_plot(data)
```

What interesting data. I *really* wish I had more high rank curves to sample. It would just make this so much more fun! But there's some interesting features that pop out at me:
1. It looks like some kind of decay, until it doesn't!
2. The variation in each rank seems to decrease from about 1 to 8, and then at 9 it covers quite a width.

Other notes:
3. I wish I could get a heat-map kind of effect on the low ranks so that I could see the distribution within the intervals that it's covering.
4. I wonder if we had more curves in each rank if we would find that many of them do have wide distributions, or if the impression the graph gives that the distributions become tighter as rank increases is accurate.
5. I could scale this calculation with more curves and increasing $C$

It could very well be that if we had something that answered my point 3 we would see that even in the low ranks there is a particularly dense region (and everywhere else has low probability), and thus it would be conceivable that in the higher ranks there's simply sampling bias. (There's part of me screaming: "*Of course* there's sampling bias, there's only one known curve for half of these ranks!")

Speaking of which, anybody that's looking at elliptic curves in Sage ought to check out [this reference page on tables of elliptic curves of a given rank](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/curves/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ec_database.html?highlight=elliptic_curves#module-sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ec_database).

[![sage reference manual entry for elliptic_curves.ec_database](http://imgur.com/ARAnyUN.jpg)](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/curves/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ec_database.html?highlight=elliptic_curves#module-sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ec_database)

So, I suppose I have a couple problems.
1. Why is the data the way it is?
    - Why does it decay the way it does?
    - What kind of distribution is there for a given rank?
    - What theory allows me to answer these questions? I don't know.
2. I need more curves!
3. Can I change the quantities calculated to get more insightful data?

On the topic of 3, wstein's [slideshow](http://wstein.org/talks/20071016-convergence/talk.pdf) goes on to talk about a new quantity he introduces called $R_E(C)$:

[![WS $R_E(C)$ slide 1](http://imgur.com/uC909EP.jpg)
![WS $R_E(C)$ slide 2](http://imgur.com/lzVQNdR.jpg)
![WS $R_E(C)$ slide 3](http://imgur.com/E7BsJdg.jpg)
![WS $R_E(C)$ slide 4](http://imgur.com/HQZHfN1.jpg)](http://wstein.org/talks/20071016-convergence/talk.pdf)

I should implement and see if I can recreate his $R_E(C)$ data. The `E.aplist()` method doesn't calculate data for $a_{p^n}$ (where $n > 1$) coefficients, so I'll have to roll my own method. Fun :) üêõ

On the topic of 2, I've been trying to hunt down papers and research on large rank families. I have a bunch, and some of the code I've been posting has implementations of sampling from these families, but none that I've found produce large number of curves with rank ‚â• 5 or 6.

The first in this list is a really nice paper, and I would recommend it to anybody interested in elliptic curves. These are the ones I really enjoy:
- [Brown and Meyer's Elliptic Curves from Mordell to Diophantus and Back](https://www.math.vt.edu/people/brown/doc/dioellip.pdf)
- [Bartosz NaskrÀõecki's Infinite family of elliptic curves of rank at least 4](http://msp.org/involve/2010/3-3/involve-v3-n3-p06-s.pdf)
- [Cecylia Bocovich's Elliptic Curves of High Rank](http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1025&context=mathcs_honors)

[![Brown and Meyer's Elliptic Curves from Mordell to Diophantus and Back](http://imgur.com/x4ha9G0.jpg)](https://www.math.vt.edu/people/brown/doc/dioellip.pdf)

One last thing: Since everything I'm doing is so heavily reliant on being able to compute the $a_p$ lists and the rank of the curve, it makes sense to have some interest in curves which are both high rank and have an easily verified rank. That leads me to [a paper by Noam Elkies and Mark Watkins called Elliptic curves of large rank and small conductor](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2958705/Elkies%20-%20Elliptic%20curves%20of%20large%20rank.pdf)

There's a list of such curves in this PDF, for which I've already done some calculations that I'll leave without comment below, and then head to bed. üõå

I made a plot for these as well!

I'd love graphics more dynamic than scatterplots, but to get that I'll have to dream up some more subtle data. I'll need to find some theory to suggest new directions soon. Who isn't excited about learning more theory? Not me! üåä
