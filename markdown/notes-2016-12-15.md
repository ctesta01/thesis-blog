### All I want for Christmas is a quadratic extension of $\mathbb Q$

I'm bummed:

```python
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
AttributeError: 'EllipticCurve_number_field_with_category' object has no
attribute 'anlist'
```

Well, I'll do more digging. I've seen Stein compute the aplist for curves over $\mathbb Q \sqrt 5$ before, and I think it's in the /tables directory in one of his talks. The closest sws file I could find is here: [sqrt5 talk demo](http://wstein.org/talks/2011-02-04-sqrt5/2011-02-04-sqrt5_talk_demo.sws)

This looks quite promising:
```python
Z = S.elliptic_curve_factors(); Z

[
Isogeny class of elliptic curves over QQ(sqrt(5)) attached to form number 0 in Hilbert modular forms of dimension 4, level 3*a+13 (of norm 199=199) over QQ(sqrt(5)),
Isogeny class of elliptic curves over QQ(sqrt(5)) attached to form number 1 in Hilbert modular forms of dimension 4, level 3*a+13 (of norm 199=199) over QQ(sqrt(5)),
Isogeny class of elliptic curves over QQ(sqrt(5)) attached to form number 2 in Hilbert modular forms of dimension 4, level 3*a+13 (of norm 199=199) over QQ(sqrt(5))
]

A = Z[0]; A.aplist(100)
[-4, -2, -3, 5, -3, 0, 2, -7, 6, -6, -4, -4, -3, 12, 0, 3, -1, -10, -12, -3, -10, -10, 0, 12]
```

So in Stein's [sqrt5 talk](http://wstein.org/talks/2011-02-04-sqrt5/) he imports the package `psage.modform.hilbert.sqrt5`, so it looks like I should install psage:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/williamstein/psage
sage setup.py develop
```

I should really spend some time to figure out what the modular forms code is doing in the psage library... Boom. I found a definition in the [psage modular forms source code](https://github.com/williamstein/psage/blob/master/psage/modform/hilbert/sqrt5/tables.py):
```python
def elliptic_curves(v, B=100, filename=None):
    from hmf import HilbertModularForms
    F = open(filename,'a') if filename else None
    for N in ideals_of_norm(v):
        H = HilbertModularForms(N)
        for i, E in enumerate(H.elliptic_curve_factors()):
            v = E.aplist(B)
            s = '%s\t%s\t%s\t%s'%(N.norm(), no_space(canonical_gen(N)), i, ' '.join([no_space(x) for x in v]))
            print s
            if F:
                F.write(s+'\n')
                F.flush()
```

Honestly everything in here looks super cool.

I wonder if the `tables.py` code I just found is how Stein made this table:

If so, I wonder how far I am away from being able to make Sato-Tate distribution statistics for elliptic curves over $\mathbb Q ( \sqrt 5 )$... Figuring all this out might take a little bit of time.

This is pretty fantastic, though:

```python
import psage.modform.hilbert.sqrt5 as H
F = H.tables.F
F.primes_above(11)
```
