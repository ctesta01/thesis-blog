# Elliptic Curves are Neat [üçµ](https://ctesta01.github.io/thesis-blog/)

An Elliptic Curve is a projective degree three nonsingular curve,
and that means that all its points (except for the point at infinity $\mathcal O = (0 : 1 : 0)$) can be transformed to have coordinates in the affine plane $z=1$, i.e. every point is rewritten $(x:y:1)$.

This yields traditional pictures of elliptic curves, like the following one for curve 496a1.
