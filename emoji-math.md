#### Television Math

Let $ðŸ“º_{\hspace .05in k} = (\{ 0, 1, ..., k,  \text {many} \}, +, -)$ be arithmetic described by $k+1$ usual integer-like elements which can be added and subtracted from one another in familiar ways. However, somebody's brain has been rotten by too much television and they can't count past $k$ anymore. After $k$, they just give up, and call any quantity of size greater than $k$ "$\text{many}$".

#### Arithmetic Table for $ðŸ“º_{ \hspace .05in 2}$

$\begin{array}{c|cc}

 +0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & ... & \text{many} \\
 +1 & 1 & 2 & \text{many} & ... & \text{many} \\

 -... & ... & ... & ... & ... & \text{many}\\

\end{array}$

One of life's greatest mysteries to the person whose brain has been melted by the television is what the quantity $\text{many} - \text{many}$ is. To them, the quantity is mysterious and long forgotten, much like an antiquated antenna radio.
